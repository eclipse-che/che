Bugs
----------------
This project uses Bugzilla to track ongoing development and issues.  Please note, as of summer 2015, Codenvy is still in the process of moving all Che issues from their internal Jira to bugzilla.  So you may want to send an email to the che-dev alias to check on any issues if you do not see them in Bugzilla.
