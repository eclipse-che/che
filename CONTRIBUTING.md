Contributing to Eclipse Che
=====================
Thanks for your interest in this project.

Project Description
--------------------
Che's objective is to create high performance developer environments by producing extensible, RESTful workspaces combined with a cloud IDE that can be customized with plug-ins. Tools are written in Java and run in the browser. If you are new to Che, please see the [getting started guide](http://eclipse.org/che/getting-started/).

Developer Resources
--------------------
Information regarding source code management, builds, and coding standards. All code contributions are made directly through commits or pull requests at http://github.com/eclipse/che.

Reporting Issues
-----------------
A great way to contribute to the project is to send a detailed report when you
encounter an issue. We always appreciate a well-written, thorough bug report,
and will thank you for it!

Check that [our issue database](https://github.com/codenvy/che/issues)
doesn't already include that problem or suggestion before submitting an issue.
If you find a match, you can use the "subscribe" button to get notified on
updates. Do *not* leave random "+1" or "I have this too" comments, as they
only clutter the discussion, and don't help resolving it. However, if you
have ways to reproduce the issue or have additional information that may help
resolving the issue, please leave a comment.

When reporting issues, always include:

* The Che version that is installed.
* The full directory path of where Che is installed.
* The output of `docker version`.
* The output of `docker info`.
* The output of `java -version`.

Also include the steps required to reproduce the problem if possible and
applicable. This information will help us review and fix your issue faster.
When sending lengthy log-files, consider posting them as a gist (https://gist.github.com).
Don't forget to remove sensitive data from your logfiles before posting (you can
replace those parts with "REDACTED").

Bugs
-----
This project uses GitHub to track ongoing development and issues.  Please note, January 2015, Codenvy is still in the process of moving all Che issues from their internal Jira to GitHub.  So you may want to send an email to the che-dev alias to check on any issues if you do not see them in Bugzilla.
