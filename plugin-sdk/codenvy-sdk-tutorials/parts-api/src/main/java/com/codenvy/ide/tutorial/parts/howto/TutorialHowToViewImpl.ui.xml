        <p>Tutorial How-To</p>
        <p>
            You can see various parts added to different areas of a workspace (on the left and right of the editor, above the editor and
            under it). This Tutorial how-to is a part itself (tab opened in the editor). Parts can be opened and minimized. We have inserted
            Click Me buttons to demonstrate that parts can perform tasks and have some business logic.
