Eclipse Che is a cloud IDE and a platform for creating cloud IDE extensions. Che ships with 55 extensions for Java, JavaScript, AngularJS, git, and Docker. Package your own Che extensions to create beautiful, cross-browser developer tooling.

Che contains:
* A cloud IDE
* A set of extensions for many programming languages, source code systems, builders and runners
* A kernel for loading extensions authored as plug-ins
* Developer tooling for building and and assembling plug-ins to create new IDEs
* A set of platform APIs for developer microservices (e.g., 'build project' or 'search worskpace')
* A CLI for interacting with platform APIs
* An Eclipse plug-in for editing, building and running Che projects from within Eclipse


![Eclipse Che](http://docs.codenvy-stg.com/wp-content/uploads/eclipse-che.png "Eclipse Che")

The IDE is a browser application that is generated by compiling extensions into JavaScript. Extensions can invoke server-side APIs that run within the Che kernel. The kernel is a servlet-based framework that loads and manages extensions. The kernel can be run in any servlet container with a default bundling of Tomcat.

Che can be installed on any operating system that supports Java 1.7 - desktop, server or cloud, and Maven 3.1.1 or higher. It has been tested on Ubuntu, Linux, MacOS and Windows. Java, GWT, GIN and Javascript are the core technologies used to build Che.

```

### Build and Run Che
```sh
cd /che
mvn clean install
./che.sh [ start | stop ]
```

This builds and starts the SDK, which includes an assembly of Java and a bare minimum of extensions building plug-ins (everything required to work with Java apps and Codenvy extensions).

Che will be available at ```localhost:8080```

### Add Your Extensions to Che
1. Create, build and compile a Che extension into a Java JAR file. [Tutorial is here] (http://docs.codenvy.com/che/). You can create extension JARs within Che or your favorite IDE. Build extensions in Eclipse gives you super dev mode for Eclipse, which makes incremental compilation fast.

2. Copy the extension's JAR file to ```/assembly-sdk/target/tomcat-ide/ext``` directory of Che.  

3. Execute ```$ ./extInstall.sh``` script. Che will be re-compiled with your extension. This will take a few minutes.

4. Restart Che.
