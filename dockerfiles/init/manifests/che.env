#
# Parameters that affect the initial system operation.
#

# IP address, hostname, or DNS
#     The IP address or DNS name of where the Che endpoint will service your users.
#     If you are running this on a local system, we auto-detect this value as the IP
#     address of your Docker daemon. On many systems, especially those from cloud hosters
#     like DigitalOcean, you must explicitly set this to the external IP address or
#     DNS entry provided by the provider. This value can be overridden on the command
#     line with '-e CHE_HOST=<value>'.
#CHE_HOST=localhost

# Port
#     The port on the host Che will bind itself to. This value can be overridden on the 
#     command line with '-e CHE_PORT=<value>'.
#CHE_PORT=8080

# Proxies
#     Che's internal services such as Java & curl need system properties applied
#     so they can reach the Internet. Che uses the Internet to reach DockerHub
#     and to route workspace activity. Che is configured to inherit proxy
#     parameters from your Docker daemon settings. Those settings are applied
#     to these variables automatically during initialization, but you can override
#     them here.
#
#     Please be mindful of proxy URL formatting. Proxies are unforgiving if the URL is
#     not typed properly, including the protocol and a trailing slash '/'.
#CHE_HTTP_PROXY=http://myproxy.com:8001/
#CHE_HTTPS_PROXY=http://myproxy.com:8001/
#CHE_NO_PROXY=<ip-or-domains-that-do-not-require-proxy-access>

# Proxies for Workspaces

#CHE_WORKSPACE_HTTP__PROXY=http://myproxy.com:8001/
#CHE_WORKSPACE_HTTPS__PROXY=http://myproxy.com:8001/
#CHE_WORKSPACE_NO__PROXY=<ip-or-domains-that-do-not-require-proxy-access>

# DNS resolving servers
#     Comma separate list of IP address that point to DNS resolving servers. In
#     some secure environments or those behind a proxy, custom DNS resolution
#     is required to resolve DNS names. You can set internal DNS servers or external
#     ones to this configuration. This applies DNS resolution to the Che server and
#     to the runtimes of the workspaces created from this Che server. This value
#     defaults to inheriting DNS resolver list from host running Che.
#CHE_DNS_RESOLVERS=<ip-of-dns-resolving-servers>

# JPDA
#     If using Che in development mode, activate this property to enable JPDA
#     mode within Che's internal Tomcat
#CHE_DEBUG_SUSPEND=false
#CHE_DEBUG_PORT=8000

# XMX
#      Che's core server runs as a Tomcat application on top of a JVM. This sets the
#      JVM XMX settings that are loaded by the JVM when the Che container boots.
#      It should be rare that you would need to change this.
#CHE_SERVER_XMX=2048

#
# User workspaces have their own runtimes. Those runtimes are composed of 1..n containers.
# We call each container a 'machine' as it is a dedicated runtime. One of the machines for

# Memory
#     The recommended RAM size for new workspaces when created from the dashboard.
#CHE_WORKSPACE_DEFAULT__MEMORY__MB=1024

# Memory Swap
#     Adjust machine swap memory by multiplication current machnine memory on provided

#CHE_WORKSPACE_VOLUME=/path/on/host:/path/in/workspace:ro,Z;/path/to/host2:/path/in/workspace2:ro,Z;

# Privileged Mode
#     Set to `true` if you would like user workspaces to be started with Docker's
#     privileged mode. Please be careful when setting this property. This allows
#     user workspaces to gain access to the underly host with root privileges.
#     However, privileged mode is needed if users want to launch their own Docker
#     containers from within their Docker-powered workspace.
#CHE_DOCKER_PRIVILEGED=false

# HostConfig SecurityOpt Parameters
#     This parameter allows to specify custom security options for the created docker container.
#     seccomp:unconfined is the default for kubernetes, but not for docker. This is needed
#     for debugging with gdbserver. See https://github.com/eclipse/che/issues/4284 for details.
#     Parameters are passed as an array, so you can add multiple 
#     values comma seperated. Please also see https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.21/#2-endpoints,
#     in particular the "HostConfig":{"SecurityOpt": []} entry. If this parameter is empty,
#     docker blocks certain Syscalls by default https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/seccomp/

#     Example: che.docker.securityopt=seccomp:unconfined,apparmor:unconfined
#CHE_DOCKER_SECURITYOPT=seccomp:unconfined

# Agent Start Timeout
#     The length of time that a workspace will be allowed to boot before the system terminates the

#   Defaults to the same value of CHE_WORKSPACE_JAVA_OPTIONS.
#CHE_WORKSPACE_MAVEN_OPTIONS=NULL

# Workspace Idle timeout
#   The length of time after which workspaces will be automatically stopped, if no activity
#   has been detected on them. Currently, keyboard and mouse interactions in IDE, as well as HTTP

#    4. Else, print connection exception

# Che Server API Endpoint
#     The location of the API end point where dashboard and IDE clients will look for
#     interacting with the Che server, which we also call the workspace master.
#CHE_API=http://${CHE_HOST}:${CHE_PORT}/api
# Che Server default websocket endpoint.
#     Provides basic communication endpoint where clients can get/push statuses/output.
#CHE_WEBSOCKET_ENDPOINT=ws://${CHE_HOST}:${CHE_PORT}/api/websocket

# Docker Daemon URL
#     How the Che server will discover the location of the Docker daemon. If this is
#     not set, then Che will use DOCKER_HOST or the default unix:///var/run/docker.sock.
#     It would be rare to need to set this as most clients set DOCKER_HOST or volume
#     mount a Docker socket when starting the Che CLI.
#CHE_DOCKER_DAEMON__URL=NULL

# Docker Host
#     How Che will connect to the Docker host if CHE_DOCKER_DAEMON__URL is not set. This
#     value can be provided on the command line as well. If this value is not set, then
#     Che will use the volume mount of unix:///var/run/docker.sock.
#DOCKER_HOST=tcp://localhost:2375

# Workspace Address Resolution Strategy
#     The strategy to determine how workspace servers users launch will be exposed. 
#     If the Che server and your workspaces are on different networks that flow through a
#     firewall, those firewalls can prevent communications between Che and workspaces.
#     The default strategy exposes workspaces with the IP of Docker and ephemeral ports.
#     A Docker local strategy uses internal Docker network IP addresses and exposed ports.
#
#     Options:
#       - 'default':      internal address is DOCKER_HOST with ephemeral ports
#       - 'docker-local': internal address is Docker network container address with
#                         exposed ports (not ephemeral)
#     on the same Docker network.
#CHE_DOCKER_SERVER__EVALUATION__STRATEGY=docker-local

# Docker IP Address
#     The IP address of the Docker daemon that is running on your host. The Che server
#     uses this IP address to establish a connection to your workspaces when they
#     first boot. This is different from how the Che server first establishes a
#     connection to the Docker daemon. After a Che server has instructed a Docker
#     Daemon to create a workspace, the Che server then discovers the location of the
#     workspace using the value of this IP address. We use auto-discovery to determine
#     this IP address. You can provide this value to override the default discovery
#     which searches Unix sockets and DOCKER_HOST. 
#CHE_DOCKER_IP=172.17.0.1

# External Docker IP Address
#     The external IP address used by browsers to connect to workspace containers that
#     are running on a Docker network. After Che has created a workspace runtime, those
#     Docker containers need to be reachable by remote browsers. Browsers will default
#     to using CHE_DOCKER_IP, then unix sockets, or DOCKER_HOST if this is not set. 
#     This will generally work if the browser and the workspace are on the same network.
#     However, if the browser and the workspaces are on different networks, then you
#     may need to set this value to the external IP address of your host or Docker to
#     make workspaces reachable.
#CHE_DOCKER_IP_EXTERNAL=NULL

# Usage of single-port routing.
# By enabling single-port, all browser traffic to Che or any workspace will be routed
# through the value that you have set to CHE_PORT`, or 8080 if not set. Setting this
# property will transform the launch sequence of Che to launch a Traefik reverse proxy.
# The reverse proxy will act as the traffic endpoint for all browser communications.
# When a new workspace is started or stopped, Che will update Traefik's configuration
# with rules for how browser traffic should be routed to Che or a workspace.
#
# With single-port, each service running in a workspace and exposing ports has its own hostname.
# Example : workspace agent will have a hostname like : ws-agent.workspace-id....domain.name
# By default the domain name will use nip.io which allow to provide wildcard DNS without any
# user configuration. The strategy used for the hosts is using the template provided by the
# CHE_DOCKER_SERVER__EVALUATION__STRATEGY_CUSTOM_TEMPLATE property with default value
#  <serverName>.<machineName>.<workspaceId>.<wildcardNipDomain>:<chePort>
# If you've your own domain and then DNS server, you may want to add wildcard DNS entry
# matching a pattern. For example updating the property to the value
#  <serverName>.<machineName>.<workspaceId>.che.foobar.com:<chePort>
# will require a wildcard *.che.foobar.com entry in DNS server resolving to the IP of the che server.
# More details on the values provided by the template can be found on documentation.

# Docker Registry for Workspace Snapshots
#     Docker is the default machine implementation within Che. Workspaces are powered
#     by machines that are constructed when the workspace is started. The images used to
#     generate containers for the machines can come from DockerHub or a private
#     Docker registry. When a workspace is "stopped", if it is saved as a snapshot, then
#     the workspace's runtime is saved as a Docker image to disk. You can optionally
#     have this image saved in a Docker registry like Artifactory or Docker Enterprise
#     registry. The default location for workspace snapshots is on disk. You can 
#     configure this property with a URL to your registry to alter the location.
#CHE_DOCKER_REGISTRY=${CHE_REGISTRY_HOST}:5000
#
#    If false, snaps are saved to disk. If true, snaps are saved in a registry.
#    The namespace is how the snapshots will be organized in the registry.
#CHE_DOCKER_REGISTRY__FOR__SNAPSHOTS=false
#CHE_DOCKER_NAMESPACE=NULL

#    By default, when users stop their workspaces, they are not snapped. You can set this
#    to automatically create snaps when they stop either due to user stopping the
#    workspace or idle timeout.
#CHE_WORKSPACE_AUTO__SNAPSHOT=false
#CHE_WORKSPACE_AUTO__RESTORE=false

#    By default, if a user accesses a workspace from its unique URL (instead of the

#    You can set this property to false to disable this behavior.
#CHE_WORKSPACE_AUTO__START=true

# Private Docker Images
#     If pushing snap images to a registry requires authenticated access to the
#     registry. Or, if your stacks reference private images which require authenticated
#     access to a registry in order to pull, then you can configure 1..n registries 
#     with authentication access. We will perform a `docker login` with this 
#     credentials before performing a snap or a pull.

#CHE_DOCKER_REGISTRY_AWS_REGISTRY1_SECRET__ACCESS__KEY=secret1

# Force Image Update
#     If true, then Che always pulls an image from a registry even if it is cached
#     If false, Docker only pulls the image if it does not exist locally. This can
#     create situations where images are not current, but a forced pull is slower.

#     sets amount of units available per whole CPU.
#     Max value of quota could be period * number of CPU cores in a system.
#     Example:
#         These values allows usage of 100% of 2 cores on 2+ cores system.
#         Period declares that 100% is equal to 5000 units
#         and container is allowed to use 2x more than 1 core.
#         Although max consumption is explained in cores performance workload will be
#         split between several cores.

# CGroup Parent
#     CGroups allow admins to to configure limits on nodes in a system in a specific
#     way. The value can start with a slash which means it will be absolute or
#     without a slash for relative value. Docker will create this cgroup if it is missing.
#     Admin can configure limits on this cgroup on all nodes in a system specific way.
#     Example:
#         On Ubuntu 16.04 use CHE_DOCKER_PARENT__CGROUP=/my_group. Then let container
#         create cgoup by running Che. Then edit
#         /sys/fs/cgroup/<resource folder>/my_group/<resource file>
#         For example to limit CPU cores to 0-1 put value "0-1" into file
#         /sys/fs/cgroup/cpuset/my_group/cpuset.cpus

# Custom che.properties Property
#     Che's server loads name=value properties in a .properties file. Those values can
#     be seen by custom extensions that are packaged within a Che server. There are
#     also Che properties that are rarely configured that are shown in documentation
#     that can be added with a custom format here. You can add as many as you would like.
#
#     Add a new property in the format of CHE_<PROPERTY_NAME>=value. If in your
#     <PROPERTY_NAME> you have a single underscore '_', that will be replaced with a
#     dot '.'. A double underscore '__' will be replaced with a single underscore '_'.
#
#     For example, CHE_WORKSPACE_AUTO__SNAPSHOT=false will be converted into the Che
#     property 'che.workspace.auto_snapshot=false'.
#CHE_WORKSPACE_AUTO__SNAPSHOT=false

# System Super Privileged Mode
#     Grants users with the manageSystem permission additional permissions for
#     getByKey, getByNameSpace, stopWorkspaces, and getResourcesInformation.
#     These are not given to admins by default and these permissions allow
#     admins gain visibility to any workspace along with naming themselves
#     with admin privileges to those workspaces.
#SYSTEM_SUPER__PRIVILEGED__MODE=false

# A complete list of internal properties used by Che are available in the default
# properties file that is embedded in the server's runtime. You can view it in our
# GitHub repository: https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/assembly/assembly-wsmaster-war/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/classes/codenvy/che.properties

# Defines Persistent Volume Claim access mode.
# Note that for common PVC strategy changing of access mode affects the number of simultaneously running workspaces.
# If OpenShift flavor where che running is using PVs with RWX access mode then a limit of running workspaces at the same time

# Workspaces are the fundamental runtime for users when doing development. You can set
# parameters that limit how workspaces are created and the resources that are consumed.
#
#     The maximum number of workspaces that a user is allowed to create. The user will
#     be presented with an error message if they try to create additional workspaces.
#     This applies to the total number of both running and stopped workspaces. Since
#     each workspace is saved as a snapshot, placing a cap on this number is a way
#     to limit the disk consumption for workspace storage.
#CHE_LIMITS_USER_WORKSPACES_COUNT=-1

#     The maximum number of running workspaces that a single user is allowed to have.
#     If the user has reached this threshold and they try to start an additional
#     workspace, they will be prompted with an error message. The user will need to
#     stop a running workspace to activate another.
#CHE_LIMITS_USER_WORKSPACES_RUN_COUNT=-1

#     The total amount of RAM that a single user is allowed to allocate to running
#     workspaces. A user can allocate this RAM to a single workspace or spread it
#     across multiple workspaces.
#CHE_LIMITS_USER_WORKSPACES_RAM=-1

#     The total amount of RAM that a single organization (team) is allowed to allocate
#     to running workspaces. An organization owner can allocate this RAM however they
#     see fit across the team's workspaces.
#CHE_LIMITS_ORGANIZATION_WORKSPACES_RAM=-1

#     The maximum number of workspaces that a organization is allowed to own. The
#     organization will be presented an error message if they try to create
#     additional workspaces. This applies to the total number of both running
#     and stopped workspaces. Since each workspace is saved as a snapshot, placing a
#     cap on this number limits the disk consumption for workspace storage.
#CHE_LIMITS_ORGANIZATION_WORKSPACES_COUNT=-1

#     The maximum number of running workspaces that a single organization is allowed.
#     If the organization has reached this threshold and they try to start an
#     additional workspace, they will be prompted with an error message. The
#     organization will need to stop a running workspace to activate another.
#CHE_LIMITS_ORGANIZATION_WORKSPACES_RUN_COUNT=-1

#     The length of time that a user is idle with their workspace when the system will
#     suspend the workspace by snapshotting it and then stopping it. Idleness is the
#     length of time that the user has not interacted with the workspace, meaning that
#     one of our agents has not received interaction. Leaving a browser window open
#     counts toward idleness.
#CHE_LIMITS_WORKSPACE_IDLE_TIMEOUT=-1

#     The maximum amount of RAM that a user can allocate to a workspace when they
#     create a new workspace. The RAM slider is adjusted to this maximum value.
