# Parameters that affect the initial system operation.
#

# IP address, hostname, or DNS
#     The IP address or DNS name of where the Che endpoint will service your users.
#     If you are running this on a local system, we auto-detect this value as the IP
#     address of your Docker daemon. On many systems, especially those from cloud hosters
#     like DigitalOcean, you must explicitly set this to the external IP address or
#     DNS entry provided by the provider. This value can be overridden on the command
#     line with '-e CHE_HOST=<value>'.
#CHE_HOST=localhost

# Port
#     The port on the host Che will bind itself to. This value can be overridden on the 
#     command line with '-e CHE_PORT=<value>'.
#CHE_PORT=8080

# Proxies
#     Che's internal services such as Java & curl need system properties applied
#     so they can reach the Internet. Che uses the Internet to reach DockerHub
#     and to route workspace activity. Che is configured to inherit proxy
#     parameters from your Docker daemon settings. Those settings are applied
#     to these variables automatically during initialization, but you can override
#     them here.
#
#     Please be mindful of proxy URL formatting. Proxies are unforgiving if the URL is
#     not typed properly, including the protocol and a trailing slash '/'.
#CHE_HTTP_PROXY=http://myproxy.com:8001/
#CHE_HTTPS_PROXY=http://myproxy.com:8001/
#CHE_NO_PROXY=<ip-or-domains-that-do-not-require-proxy-access>

# Proxies for Workspaces

#CHE_WORKSPACE_HTTP__PROXY=http://myproxy.com:8001/
#CHE_WORKSPACE_HTTPS__PROXY=http://myproxy.com:8001/
#CHE_WORKSPACE_NO__PROXY=<ip-or-domains-that-do-not-require-proxy-access>

# DNS resolving servers
#     Comma separate list of IP address that point to DNS resolving servers. In
#     some secure environments or those behind a proxy, custom DNS resolution
#     is required to resolve DNS names. You can set internal DNS servers or external
#     ones to this configuration. This applies DNS resolution to the Che server and
#     to the runtimes of the workspaces created from this Che server. This value
#     defaults to inheriting DNS resolver list from host running Che.
#CHE_DNS_RESOLVERS=<ip-of-dns-resolving-servers>

# JPDA
#     If using Che in development mode, activate this property to enable JPDA
#     mode within Che's internal Tomcat
#CHE_DEBUG_SUSPEND=false
#CHE_DEBUG_PORT=8000

# XMX
#      Che's core server runs as a Tomcat application on top of a JVM. This sets the
#      JVM XMX settings that are loaded by the JVM when the Che container boots.
#      It should be rare that you would need to change this.
#CHE_SERVER_XMX=2048

# Pull Request Generation
#     If true (default), then generates a Factory URL embedded within the PR
#     generated by Che for provider that manages the pull request. The PR
#     factory is a URL that generates a workspace that contains the commit of
#     the PR itself. Setting this to false will generate a PR without an
#     embedded Factory URL. Generate PRs using the pull request panel in the IDE.

# Docker Daemon URL
#     How the Che server will discover the location of the Docker daemon. If this is
#     not set, then Che will use DOCKER_HOST or the default unix:///var/run/docker.sock.
#     It would be rare to need to set this as most clients set DOCKER_HOST or volume

#CHE_DOCKER_DAEMON__URL=NULL

# Docker Host
#     How Che will connect to the Docker host if CHE_DOCKER_DAEMON__URL is not set. This
#     value can be provided on the command line as well. If this value is not set, then
#     Che will use the volume mount of unix:///var/run/docker.sock.
#DOCKER_HOST=tcp://localhost:2375

# Workspace Address Resolution Strategy
#     The strategy to determine how workspace servers users launch will be exposed. 
#     If the Che server and your workspaces are on different networks that flow through a
#     firewall, those firewalls can prevent communications between Che and workspaces.
#     The default strategy exposes workspaces with the IP of Docker and ephemeral ports.
#     A Docker local strategy uses internal Docker network IP addresses and exposed ports.
#
#     Options:
#       - 'default':      internal address is DOCKER_HOST with ephemeral ports
#       - 'docker-local': internal address is Docker network container address with

#CHE_DOCKER_SERVER__EVALUATION__STRATEGY=docker-local

# Docker IP Address
#     The IP address of the Docker daemon that is running on your host. The Che server
#     uses this IP address to establish a connection to your workspaces when they
#     first boot. This is different from how the Che server first establishes a
#     connection to the Docker daemon. After a Che server has instructed a Docker
#     Daemon to create a workspace, the Che server then discovers the location of the
#     workspace using the value of this IP address. We use auto-discovery to determine
#     this IP address. You can provide this value to override the default discovery
#     which searches Unix sockets and DOCKER_HOST. 
#CHE_DOCKER_IP=172.17.0.1

# External Docker IP Address
#     The external IP address used by browsers to connect to workspace containers that
#     are running on a Docker network. After Che has created a workspace runtime, those
#     Docker containers need to be reachable by remote browsers. Browsers will default
#     to using CHE_DOCKER_IP, then unix sockets, or DOCKER_HOST if this is not set. 
#     This will generally work if the browser and the workspace are on the same network.
#     However, if the browser and the workspaces are on different networks, then you
#     may need to set this value to the external IP address of your host or Docker to
#     make workspaces reachable.

# Docker Registry for Workspace Snapshots
#     Docker is the default machine implementation within Che. Workspaces are powered
#     by machines that are constructed when the workspace is started. The images used to
#     generate containers for the machines can come from DockerHub or a private
#     Docker registry. When a workspace is "stopped", if it is saved as a snapshot, then
#     the workspace's runtime is saved as a Docker image to disk. You can optionally
#     have this image saved in a Docker registry like Artifactory or Docker Enterprise
#     registry. The default location for workspace snapshots is on disk. You can 
#     configure this property with a URL to your registry to alter the location.
#CHE_DOCKER_REGISTRY=${CHE_REGISTRY_HOST}:5000
#
#    If false, snaps are saved to disk. If true, snaps are saved in a registry.
#    The namespace is how the snapshots will be organized in the registry.
#CHE_DOCKER_REGISTRY__FOR__SNAPSHOTS=false
#CHE_DOCKER_NAMESPACE=NULL

#    By default, when users stop their workspaces, they are not snapped. You can set this
#    to automatically create snaps when they stop either due to user stopping the
#    workspace or idle timeout.
#CHE_WORKSPACE_AUTO__SNAPSHOT=false
#CHE_WORKSPACE_AUTO__RESTORE=false

#    By default, if a user accesses a workspace from its unique URL (instead of the

#CHE_WORKSPACE_AUTO__START=true

# Private Docker Images
#     If pushing snap images to a registry requires authenticated access to the
#     registry. Or, if your stacks reference private images which require authenticated
#     access to a registry in order to pull, then you can configure 1..n registries 
#     with authentication access. We will perform a `docker login` with this 
#     credentials before performing a snap or a pull.

# Force Image Update
#     If true, then Che always pulls an image from a registry even if it is cached

#     sets amount of units available per whole CPU.
#     Max value of quota could be period * number of CPU cores in a system.
#     Example:
#         These values allows usage of 100% of 2 cores on 2+ cores system.
#         Period declares that 100% is equal to 5000 units
#         and container is allowed to use 2x more than 1 core.
#         Although max consumption is explained in cores performance workload will be
#         split between several cores.

# CGroup Parent
#     CGroups allow admins to to configure limits on nodes in a system in a specific
#     way. The value can start with a slash which means it will be absolute or
#     without a slash for relative value. Docker will create this cgroup if it is missing.
#     Admin can configure limits on this cgroup on all nodes in a system specific way.
#     Example:
#         On Ubuntu 16.04 use CHE_DOCKER_PARENT__CGROUP=/my_group. Then let container
#         create cgoup by running Che. Then edit
#         /sys/fs/cgroup/<resource folder>/my_group/<resource file>
#         For example to limit CPU cores to 0-1 put value "0-1" into file
#         /sys/fs/cgroup/cpuset/my_group/cpuset.cpus
