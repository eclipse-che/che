### CHE SERVER
# Folder where Che will store internal data objects
che.database=${che.home}/storage

# API service. Browsers initiate REST communications to Che server with this URL
che.api=http://localhost:${SERVER_PORT}/wsmaster/api

# Your projects are synchronized from the Che server into the machine running each
# workspace. This is the directory in the ws runtime where your projects are mounted.
che.workspace.storage=${che.home}/workspaces

# Your projects are synchronized from the Che server into the machine running each
# workspace. This is the directory in the machine where your projects are placed.
che.workspace.projects.storage=/projects

# Configures proxies used by runtimes powering workspaces
che.workspace.http_proxy=
che.workspace.https_proxy=
che.workspace.no_proxy=

# During the stop of the workspace automatically creates a snapshot if the value is {true},
# Otherwise just stops the workspace.
che.workspace.auto_snapshot=true

# During the start of the workspace automatically restore it from a snapshot if the value is {true},
# Otherwise create a new workspace.
che.workspace.auto_restore=true

# Java command line options used to start Che agent in workspace runtime
che.workspace.java_opts=-Xms256m -Xmx2048m -Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom

# Folder that will be a volume mount from your host into your workspace.
che.workspace.volume=

# If your workspace creates SSH connections, their timeouts are managed by this property.
che.workspace.ssh_connection_timeout_ms=10000

# The location of the Web terminal used within the browser.
# This is copied into the workspace and runs within the workspace.
# Suffix helps differentiate archive for different architectures/OSes
che.workspace.terminal_linux_amd64=${che.home}/lib/linux_amd64/terminal
che.workspace.terminal_linux_arm7=${che.home}/lib/linux_arm7/terminal

# Folder where the workspace will store logs from agents and other runtimes
che.workspace.logs=${che.logs.dir}/machine/logs

# RAM default for new machines.
# TODO: is this per machine, or for the entire environment?
che.workspace.default_memory_mb=1024

# This archive contains the server to run the workspace agent and any custom extensions.
# Che injects this archive into machines when they are booted or started.
# Each machine can have many agents installed, each located in a different location.
che.workspace.agent.dev=${che.home}/lib/ws-agent.tar.gz

# Hosts listed here will be added to /etc/hosts of each workspace.
che.workspace.hosts=NULL

# This is the API endpoint of the workspace master running within the core Che server.
# This tells the workspace agent how to connect back to the Che server.
# che-host is a hostname entry added to /etc/hosts of the workspace by the Che server.

### AGENTS
# When the Che server launches a new workspace, Che pings a mini Che server running inside of the
# workspace runtime. We call this mini-Che an "agent". The Che server knows that the workspace
# is ready for user when the agent returns a valid response.
che.workspace.agent.dev.max_start_time_ms=180000
che.workspace.agent.dev.ping_delay_ms=2000
che.workspace.agent.dev.ping_conn_timeout_ms=2000
che.workspace.agent.dev.ping_timeout_error_msg=Timeout. The Che server is unable to ping your workspace. This implies a network configuration issue, workspace boot failure, or an unusually slow workspace boot.

che.agent.dev.max_start_time_ms=120000
che.agent.dev.ping_delay_ms=2000

### TEMPLATES
# Folder that contains JSON files with code templates and samples
che.template.storage=${che.home}/templates

### STACKS
# File name containing default stacks definitions
che.stacks.storage=${che.home}/stacks/stacks.json

# che.stacks.default=${che.home}/stacks/stacks.json
# Folder name where stack images are stored
che.stacks.images=${che.home}/stacks/images

### AUTHENTICATION PARAMETERS
# Che has a single identity implementation, so this does not change the user experience.
# If true, enables user creation at API level
che.auth.user_self_creation=false

che.auth.access_denied_error_page=/error-oauth

# Reserved user names
che.auth.reserved_user_names=

# You can setup GitHub oAuth to automate authentication to remote repositories.
# You need to first register this application with GitHub oAuth.

### DOCKER PARAMETERS
# Docker is the default machine implementation within Che. Workspaces are powered by machines
# that are constructed when the workspace is started. The images used to generate containers
# for the machines can come from DockerHub or a private Docker registry.
che.docker.registry=${CHE_REGISTRY_HOST}:5000

# If this is true, then we always pull an image from a registry even if we have an image cached
# locally. If false, Docker only pulls image if it does not exist locally.
che.docker.always_pull_image=true

# If true, then launches all workspace runtime containers with Docker's
# privilged mode. Please use responsibly. This is required if you want Che workspaces
# to be able to launch their own runtimes which are embedded Docker containers.
che.docker.privilege=false

# Limits the number of processes that can be forked inside a cgroup. Set -1 for unlimited.
# Since 4.3 kernel.

che.docker.volumes_agent_options=ro,Z

# If the browser clients that are accessing Che are remote AND the configuration of Docker is an
# internal IP address or using Unix sockets, then remote browser clients will not be able to connect
# to the workspace. Set the Docker configuration so that Docker containers have an external IP
# address and provide that external host or IP address here.
# This is uncommon, and only needed for advanced Docker configurations.
che.docker.ip=NULL

# The hostname that a browser should use to connect to a workspace container.
# Only set this if your workspace containers are not directly pingable.
# This is unusual, but happens for example in Docker for Mac when containers are in a VM.
che.docker.ip.external=NULL

# Provides a Docker network where Che server is running.
# Workspace containers created by Che will be added to this Docker network.
# Communications between the Che server and container occur over this network.

# Use a Docker registry for workspace snapshots. If false, snaps are saved to disk.

# Allows to adjust machine swap memory by multiplying current machnine memory to provided value.
# default is -1 which is unlimited swap. If set, value is multipled by machine memory set by user
# to determine swap size. To disable swap set to 0.
