# Workspace threads pool configuration, this pool is used for workspace related

che.workspace.pool.type=fixed

# This property is ignored when pool type is different from 'fixed'.

### AGENTS
# When the Che server launches a new workspace, Che pings a mini Che server running inside of the
# workspace runtime. We call this mini-Che an "agent". The Che server knows that the workspace

# Idle Timeout
#     The system will suspend the workspace and snapshot it if the end user is idle for
#     this amount of time. Idleness is determined by the length of time that a user has
#     not interacted with the workspace. Leaving a browser window open counts as idleness time.

che.workspace.activity_check_scheduler_period_s=60

### TEMPLATES

# If true, enables user creation at API level
che.auth.user_self_creation=false

che.auth.access_denied_error_page=/error-oauth

che.oauth.github.redirecturis= http://localhost:${CHE_PORT}/api/oauth/callback


### DOCKER PARAMETERS
# Docker is the default machine implementation within Che. Workspaces are powered by machines
# that are constructed when the workspace is started. The images used to generate containers
# for the machines can come from DockerHub or a private Docker registry.
che.docker.registry=${CHE_REGISTRY_HOST}:5000

# If this is true, then we always pull an image from a registry even if we have an image cached
# locally. If false, Docker only pulls image if it does not exist locally.
che.docker.always_pull_image=true

# If true, then launches all workspace runtime containers with Docker's
# privileged mode. Please use responsibly. This is required if you want Che workspaces
# to be able to launch their own runtimes which are embedded Docker containers.
che.docker.privileged=false

# Limits the number of processes that can be forked inside a cgroup. Set -1 for unlimited.
# Since 4.3 kernel.
che.docker.pids_limit=-1

# Sets parent cgroup for cgroups of containers created by workspaces.
# This allows an admin to set custom cgroup limitations to all containers of workspaces by configuring cgroups.
# Example:
# /my_group
# my_another_group
che.docker.parent_cgroup=NULL

# Sets set of CPUs that can be used by each container of started workspace.
# Example:
# 0-3
# 1,4
che.docker.cpuset_cpus=NULL

# Next 2 properties set limits on CPU consumption by containers of started workspaces.
# Period sets amount of units per CPU core.
# Quota sets amount of units available for container per whole CPU.
# Max value of quota could be period * number of CPU cores in a system.
# Example:
# che.docker.cpu_period=5000
# che.docker.cpu_quota=10000
che.docker.cpu_period=0

# If the browser clients that are accessing Che are remote AND the configuration of Docker is an
# internal IP address or using Unix sockets, then remote browser clients will not be able to connect
# to the workspace. Set the Docker configuration so that Docker containers have an external IP
# address and provide that external host or IP address here.
# This is uncommon, and only needed for advanced Docker configurations.
che.docker.ip=NULL

# The hostname that a browser should use to connect to a workspace container.
# Only set this if your workspace containers are not directly pingable.
# This is unusual, but happens for example in Docker for Mac when containers are in a VM.
che.docker.ip.external=NULL

# The server evaluation strategy to be used to determine servers exposed by workspaces.
# Options:
#   - 'default':      internal address is address of docker host and ephemeral port are used
#   - 'docker-local': internal address is address of container within docker network, and exposed ports
#                     are used.
#   - 'custom': The evaluation strategy may be customized through a template property.
#   - 'docker-local-custom':  internal address is set as in docker-local strategy, external address is composed
#                     as in the custom strategy with the 'template' and the 'external.protocol' properties.

# The 'docker-local' strategy may be useful if a firewall prevents communication between che-server and
# workspace containers, but will prevent communication when che-server and workspace containers are not
# on the same Docker network.
# The 'docker-local-custom' strategy may be useful when Che and the workspace servers need to be exposed on the
# same single TCP port.
che.docker.server_evaluation_strategy=default


# Here are macros available for the custom server evaluation strategy
# serverName: server reference exposing the port (like tomcat8, ws-agent, etc)
# machineName: name of the machine of the workspace. (like devMachine)
# workspaceId: id of the workspace
# internalIp: IP of the internal address of che (che.docker.ip property)
# externalIP: IP of the external address of che
# externalAddresss : external address of che (che.docker.ip.external or if null che.docker.ip)
# chePort : Che listening port number of workspace master
# wildcardNipDomain : get external address transformed into a nip.io DNS sub-domain
# wildcardXipDomain : get external address transformed into a xip.io DNS sub-domain
# user : name of the current user 
# workspacesRoutingSuffix: explicit routing suffix for workspace agents (see property che.workspaces.routing-suffix)
