[id="che_infra_kubernetes_namespace_default_{context}"]
= `+CHE_INFRA_KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE_DEFAULT+`

Defines Kubernetes default namespace in which user's workspaces are created if user does not override it. It's possible to use `<username>` and `<userid>` placeholders (for example: `che-workspace-<username>`). In that case, new namespace will be created for each user (or workspace). Used by OpenShift infra as well to specify a Project. The `<workspaceid>` placeholder is deprecated and is subject to removal in future releases. The `<username>` or `<userid>` placeholder is mandatory.
