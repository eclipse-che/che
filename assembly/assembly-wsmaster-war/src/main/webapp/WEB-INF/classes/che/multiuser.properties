### Che system

# System Super Privileged Mode.
# Grants users with the manageSystem permission additional permissions for
# getByKey, getByNameSpace, stopWorkspaces, and getResourcesInformation.
# These are not given to administrators by default and these permissions allow
# administrators gain visibility to any workspace along with naming themselves
# with administrator privileges to those workspaces.
che.system.super_privileged_mode=false

# Grant system permission for 'che.admin.name' user. If the user already exists it'll happen on
# component startup, if not - during the first login when user is persisted in the database.
che.system.admin_name=admin

### Workspace limits

# Workspaces are the fundamental runtime for users when doing development. You can set
# parameters that limit how workspaces are created and the resources that are consumed.
# The maximum amount of RAM that a user can allocate to a workspace when they
# create a new workspace. The RAM slider is adjusted to this maximum value.
che.limits.workspace.env.ram=16gb

# The length of time in milliseconds that a user is idle with their workspace when the system will
# suspend the workspace and then stopping it. Idleness is the
# length of time that the user has not interacted with the workspace, meaning that
# one of the agents has not received interaction. Leaving a browser window open
# counts toward idleness.
che.limits.workspace.idle.timeout=1800000

# The length of time in milliseconds that a workspace will run, regardless of activity, before
# the system will suspend it. Set this property if you want to automatically stop
# workspaces after a period of time. The default is zero, meaning that there is no
# run timeout.
che.limits.workspace.run.timeout=0

### Users workspace limits

# The total amount of RAM that a single user is allowed to allocate to running
# workspaces. A user can allocate this RAM to a single workspace or spread it
# across multiple workspaces.
che.limits.user.workspaces.ram=-1

# The maximum number of workspaces that a user is allowed to create. The user will
# be presented with an error message if they try to create additional workspaces.
# This applies to the total number of both running and stopped workspaces.
che.limits.user.workspaces.count=-1

# The maximum number of running workspaces that a single user is allowed to have.
# If the user has reached this threshold and they try to start an additional
# workspace, they will be prompted with an error message. The user will need to
# stop a running workspace to activate another.
che.limits.user.workspaces.run.count=1

### Organizations workspace limits

# The total amount of RAM that a single organization (team) is allowed to allocate
# to running workspaces. An organization owner can allocate this RAM however they
# see fit across the team's workspaces.
che.limits.organization.workspaces.ram=-1

# The maximum number of workspaces that a organization is allowed to own. The
# organization will be presented an error message if they try to create
# additional workspaces. This applies to the total number of both running
# and stopped workspaces.
che.limits.organization.workspaces.count=-1

# The maximum number of running workspaces that a single organization is allowed.
# If the organization has reached this threshold and they try to start an
# additional workspace, they will be prompted with an error message. The
# organization will need to stop a running workspace to activate another.
che.limits.organization.workspaces.run.count=-1

### Multi-user-specific OpenShift infrastructure configuration

# Alias of the OpenShift identity provider registered in Keycloak,
# that should be used to create workspace OpenShift resources in
# OpenShift namespaces owned by the current Che user.
# Should be set to NULL if `che.infra.openshift.project`
# is set to a non-empty value.
# For more information see the following documentation:
# https://www.keycloak.org/docs/3.3/server_admin/topics/identity-broker/social/openshift.html
che.infra.openshift.oauth_identity_provider=NULL

### Keycloak configuration

# Url to keycloak identity provider server
# Can be set to NULL only if `che.keycloak.oidcProvider`
# is used
che.keycloak.auth_server_url=http://${CHE_HOST}:5050/auth

# Internal network service Url to keycloak identity provider server
che.keycloak.auth_internal_server_url=NULL

# Keycloak realm is used to authenticate users
# Can be set to NULL only if `che.keycloak.oidcProvider`
# is used
che.keycloak.realm=che

# Keycloak client id in che.keycloak.realm that is used by dashboard, IDE and CLI to authenticate users
che.keycloak.client_id=che-public
        
# URL to access OSO OAuth tokens
che.keycloak.oso.endpoint=NULL

# URL to access GitHub OAuth tokens
che.keycloak.github.endpoint=NULL

# The number of seconds to tolerate for clock skew when verifying exp or NBF claims.
che.keycloak.allowed_clock_skew_sec=3

# Use the OIDC optional `nonce` feature to increase security.
che.keycloak.use_nonce=true

# URL to the Keycloak Javascript adapter we want to use.
# if set to NULL, then the default used value is
# `${che.keycloak.auth_server_url}/js/keycloak.js`,
# or `<che-server>/api/keycloak/OIDCKeycloak.js`
# if an alternate `oidc_provider` is used
che.keycloak.js_adapter_url=NULL

# Base URL of an alternate OIDC provider that provides
# a discovery endpoint as detailed in the following specification
# https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html#ProviderConfig
che.keycloak.oidc_provider=NULL

# Set to true when using an alternate OIDC provider that
# only supports fixed redirect URLs
# This property is ignored when `che.keycloak.oidc_provider` is NULL
che.keycloak.use_fixed_redirect_urls=false

# Username claim to be used as user display name
# when parsing JWT token
# if not defined the fallback value is 'preferred_username'
che.keycloak.username_claim=NULL

# Configuration of OAuth Authentication Service that can be used in "embedded" or "delegated" mode.
# If set to "embedded", then the service work as a wrapper to Che's OAuthAuthenticator ( as in Single User mode).
# If set to "delegated", then the service will use Keycloak IdentityProvider mechanism.
# Runtime exception will be thrown, in case if this property is not set properly.
che.oauth.service_mode=delegated

# Configuration for enabling removing user from Keycloak server on removing user from Che database.
# By default it's disabled. Can be enabled in some special cases when deleting a user in Che database
# should execute removing related-user from Keycloak.
# For correct work need to set an administrator username ${che.keycloak.admin_username} and password
# ${che.keycloak.admin_password}.
che.keycloak.cascade_user_removal_enabled=false

# Keycloak administrator username. Will be used for deleting user from Keycloak on removing user
# from Che database. Make sense only in case ${che.keycloak.cascade_user_removal_enabled}
# set to 'true'
che.keycloak.admin_username=NULL

# Keycloak administrator password. Will be used for deleting user from Keycloak on removing user
# from Che database. Make sense only in case ${che.keycloak.cascade_user_removal_enabled}
# set to 'true'
che.keycloak.admin_password=NULL

# User name adjustment configuration. Che needs to use the usernames as part of Kubernetes object names and labels and
# therefore has stricter requirements on their format than the identity providers usually
# allow (it needs them to be DNS-compliant). The adjustment is represented by comma-separated key-value pairs.
# These are sequentially used as arguments to the String.replaceAll function on the original username.
# The keys are regular expressions, values are replacement strings that replace the characters in the username
# that match the regular expression. The modified username will only be stored in the Che database
# and will not be advertised back to the identity provider.
# It is recommended to use DNS-compliant characters as replacement strings (values in the key-value pairs).
# Example: `\\=-,@=-at-` changes `\` to `-` and `@` to `-at-`
# so the username `org\user@com` becomes `org-user-at-com.`
che.keycloak.username.replacement_patterns=NULL
