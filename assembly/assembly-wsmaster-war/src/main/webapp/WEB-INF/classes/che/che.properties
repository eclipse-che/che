# Default Editor that should be provisioned into Devfile if there is no specified Editor
# Format is `editorPublisher/editorName/editorVersion` value.

# All the plugins from this list that are not explicitly mentioned in the user-defined devfile
# will be provisioned but only when the default editor is used or if the user-defined editor is
# the same as the default one (even if in different version).
