### OpenShift Infra parameters

# Since OpenShift infrastructure reuse {kubernetes} infrastructure components
# OpenShift infrastructure reuse most of the {kubernetes} configuration attributes.

# DEPRECATED - Do not change the value of this property otherwise the existing workspaces will loose data. Do not
# set it on new installations.
#
# Defines OpenShift {orch-namespace} in which all workspaces will be created.
# If not set, every workspace will be created in a new project, where project name = workspace id
# It's possible to use `<username>` and `<userid>` placeholders (for example: `che-workspace-<username>`).
# In that case, new project will be created for each user. OpenShift OAuth or service account with
# permission to create new projects must be used.
#
# If the project pointed to by this property exists, it will be used for all workspaces. If it does not exist,
# the {orch-namespace} specified by the `che.infra.kubernetes.namespace.default` will be created and used.
# This parameter is subject to removal in future releases.
# Legacy workspaces located in this {orch-namespace} may become unreachable in future releases.
# See the documentation for possible next steps.
che.infra.openshift.project=

# Comma separated list of labels to add to the CA certificates ConfigMap in user workspace.

# Docker image of {prod-short} plugin broker app that resolves workspace tools configuration and copies plugins dependencies to a workspace.

# The configuration property that defines available values for storage types that clients such as the Dashboard should propose to users during workspace creation and update.
# Available values:
#   - `persistent`: Persistent Storage slow I/O but persistent.
#   - `ephemeral`: Ephemeral Storage allows for faster I/O but may have limited storage
#       and is not persistent.
#   - `async`: Experimental feature: Asynchronous storage is combination of Ephemeral
#       and Persistent storage. Allows for faster I/O and keep your changes, will backup on stop
#       and restore on start workspace.
