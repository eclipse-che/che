### DOCKER PARAMETERS
# Docker is the default machine implementation within Che. Workspaces are powered by machines
# that are constructed when the workspace is started. The images used to generate containers
# for the machines can come from DockerHub or a private Docker registry.
che.docker.registry=${CHE_REGISTRY_HOST}:5000

# If this is true, then we always pull an image from a registry even if we have an image cached
# locally. If false, Docker only pulls image if it does not exist locally.
che.docker.always_pull_image=true

# If true, then launches all workspace runtime containers with Docker's
# privileged mode. Please use responsibly. This is required if you want Che workspaces
# to be able to launch their own runtimes which are embedded Docker containers.
che.docker.privileged=false

# This parameter allows to specify custom security options for the created docker container.
# seccomp:unconfined is the default for kubernetes, but not for docker. This is needed
# for debugging with gdbserver. See https://github.com/eclipse/che/issues/4284 for details.
# Parameters are passed as an array, so you can add multiple 
# values comma seperated. Please also see https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.21/#2-endpoints,
# in particular the "HostConfig":{"SecurityOpt": []} entry. If this parameter is empty,
# docker blocks certain Syscalls by default https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/seccomp/
# WARNING: if you give incorrect values, docker gives an error and doesn't start the container
# Example: che.docker.securityopt=seccomp:unconfined,apparmor:unconfined

# 0-3
# 1,4
che.docker.cpuset_cpus=NULL

# Next 2 properties set limits on CPU consumption by containers of started workspaces.
# Period sets amount of units per CPU core.
# Quota sets amount of units available for container per whole CPU.
# Max value of quota could be period * number of CPU cores in a system.
# Example:
# che.docker.cpu_period=5000
# che.docker.cpu_quota=10000

# If the browser clients that are accessing Che are remote AND the configuration of Docker is an
# internal IP address or using Unix sockets, then remote browser clients will not be able to connect
# to the workspace. Set the Docker configuration so that Docker containers have an external IP
# address and provide that external host or IP address here.
# This is uncommon, and only needed for advanced Docker configurations.
che.docker.ip=NULL

# Only set this if your workspace containers are not directly pingable.
# This is unusual, but happens for example in Docker for Mac when containers are in a VM.
che.docker.ip.external=NULL

# The server evaluation strategy to be used to determine servers exposed by workspaces.
# Options:
#   - 'default':      internal address is address of docker host and ephemeral port are used
#   - 'docker-local': internal address is address of container within docker network, and exposed ports
#                     are used.
#   - 'custom': The evaluation strategy may be customized through a template property.
#   - 'docker-local-custom':  internal address is set as in docker-local strategy, external address is composed
#                     as in the custom strategy with the 'template' and the 'external.protocol' properties.

# The 'docker-local' strategy may be useful if a firewall prevents communication between che-server and
# workspace containers, but will prevent communication when che-server and workspace containers are not
# on the same Docker network.
# The 'docker-local-custom' strategy may be useful when Che and the workspace servers need to be exposed on the
# same single TCP port.
