# Note that for a single-host deployment strategy to work, a controller supporting URL rewriting has to be
# used (so that URLs can point to different servers while the servers don't need to support changing the app root).

# transformed to support the URL rewriting and this property defines the set of annotations on the ingress itself
# that instruct the chosen ingress controller to actually do the URL rewriting, potentially building on the path
# transformation (if required by the chosen ingress controller).

#     "ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-connect-timeout": "3600","ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-read-timeout": "3600"}
# and the che.infra.kubernetes.ingress.path.rewrite_transform should be set to "%s(.*)"
#
# For nginx ingress controller older than 0.22.0, the rewrite-target should be set to merely "/" and the path transform
# to "%s" (see the the che.infra.kubernetes.ingress.path.rewrite_transform property).

# must be a valid input to the String.format() method and contain exactly one reference to "%s".
#
# Please see the description of the che.infra.kubernetes.ingress.annotations_json property to see how these two
# properties interplay when specifying the ingress annotations and path.

# The configuration property that defines available values for storage types that clients like
# Dashboard should propose for users during workspace creation/update.
# Available values:
#   - 'persistent': Persistent Storage slow I/O but persistent.
#   - 'ephemeral': Ephemeral Storage allows for faster I/O but may have limited storage
#       and is not persistent.
#   - 'async': Experimental feature: Asynchronous storage is combination of Ephemeral
#       and Persistent storage. Allows for faster I/O and keep your changes, will backup on stop
#       and restore on start workspace.

# the same as the default one (even if in different version).
# Format is comma-separated `pluginPublisher/pluginName/pluginVersion` values, and URLs. For example:
# eclipse/che-theia-exec-plugin/0.0.1,eclipse/che-theia-terminal-plugin/0.0.1,https://cdn.pluginregistry.com/vi-mode/meta.yaml
